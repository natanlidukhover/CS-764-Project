Deliverables:

Your submission should be a zip file that includes:

Your full source code with clear documentations

A makefile that compiles all your executables

And README file that includes: 

    Each group member's names and student IDs

    The techniques (see Grading) implemented by your submission and the corresponding source files and lines

    A brief writeup of (1) the reasons you chose to implement the specific subset of techniques (2) the project's state (complete or have what kinds of bugs) (3) how to run your programs if they are different from the default specifications above. This is not expected to be a lengthy document, just to assist our understandings of your work.

    Each group member's contributions to the project
    

Group Members:

- Shivam Hire
- Tyler Wilson
- Natan Lidukhover
- Smit Shah

Techniques Implemented: 

- Quicksort:
	We chose to implement quicksort for cache sized sorting only.
	
- Tournament Tree:
	Used during merge sort with OVC to increase speed and efficiency.
	
- Minimum count of row & column comparisons

- Cache sized mini runs:
	See 
- Device optimized page sizes
- Verifying sets of rows and values/sort order
- Variable size records
- Offset value coding
- Compression
- Prefix truncation
- run size > memory size
- Spilling memory to SSD
- Spilling from SSD to Disk
- Graceful degradation
